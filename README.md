Hey If you want to learn how to the SEARCHING ALGORITHAMS works 
so that repository is for you if order to under the Breadth First Search and Depth First Search 
I have tried to make you understand how this algo works by the help of a game a maze game.

if order to properly understand and run this code and get the output make sure you have downloaded the requirements.txt along with it
make sure to work carefully with the curses module and do not press anything un-necessary to the keyboard as it will halt the process and termintes it

along with it I am providing a more different file (it is the one with some changes) , I have also introduced the new funtion to create your own maze via the code it is a bit complex but you just need to understand the code first and it will make some means.

#Happy_Learning
